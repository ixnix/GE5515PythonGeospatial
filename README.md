# GE5515: Python for Geospatial Analysis

Graduate course at Michigan Technological University taught by [Xin Xi](https://xinxi.page/).

## Course Description

This course introduces Python programming for geospatial data analysis. Students learn to manage, analyze, and visualize spatial and non-spatial data using open-source Python libraries. Topics span the full geospatial analysis pipeline — from vector and raster fundamentals to advanced applications like watershed delineation and climate data analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Create the course environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f module_0/environment.yml
   conda activate pythongis
   ```
3. Launch JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
